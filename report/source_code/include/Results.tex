\section{Mean Square Displacement}

The main objective that was mentioned before is to try to observe how 
the behavior of the particles change with the parameters being used, 
the number of bugs, the number of passive particles and the weight of the passive particles. 
More specifically if any phase transition similar to \cite{nilsson2017metastable} can be observed.
A good way to start is to use the same quantitative measurement to see if there are any similarities.
Firstly, the mean square displacement (MSD) of the active particles is measured. Using MSD 
will give us an idea about the character of the active particles motion over time. 
The MSD is often used to check whether the motion of a system is due to diffusion or if there is 
a force contributing. The mean square displacement in 2-dimensions can be expressed as follows

\begin{align}
	MSD(\tau)   &=  \langle (x(t+\tau)-x(t))^2 + (y(t+\tau)-y(t))^2\rangle \label{eqn:2dim_msd}\\
		    &=  \dfrac{1}{N-\tau}\sum_{t=1}^{N}\left( x(\tau+t)-x(t)\right)^2 + \left( y(\tau+t)-y(t)\right)^2
\end{align}

What is to be expected is the result from \cite{nilsson2017metastable}
where the MSD for the active particles is higher at a low noise level, in our case 
low obstacle weight, and the MSD lower at a high noise level, high obstacle weight in our case. 
Other expected results from the experiment are also that MSD will be higher for cases with low obstacle density.
%The results below confirms the expectations.

Firstly the active particles MSD is measured as a function of number of bugs.
In \cref{fig:msd_NB} the MSD of the active particles is calculated in 4 cases with 
different obstacle weight and number of obstacles. A general trend can be observed 
from \cref{fig:msd_NB} where the MSD is lower when the number of active particles 
is high, and inversely the MSD is higher when the number of active particles is low.

How the number of active particles affect the MSD is not obvious, compared to the 
obstacle weight as a parameter where there is a strong intuition of the fact that 
heavier obstacles will prevent the bugs from moving, hence lower MSD. 
There are though certain behaviors from the active particles that depend on 
their number and might in turn affect the MSD. This will be discussed further in 
\cref{collective_behaviors}\\

%experiments with 100 obstacles with mass of $\SI{17e-3}{kg}$ each, 
%and the different lines corresponds to different number of bugs. As can be observed here is that the 
%MSD for the different cases have similar shape where they increase linearly in the beginning and plateau 
%at some point. The plateau starts in most cases around $\tau\approx\SI{2e2}{\second}$ and the differences 
%between the lines is that they are shifted vertically depending on the number of bugs that were used in the experiments.
%The lowest line(blue line in \cref{fig:temp}) which is the lowest MSD value corresponds to the experiment 
%with 1 bug and the highest line(light purple) corresponds to the experiment with 25 bugs. 
%All the intermediate lines follow the trend where higher MSD corresponds with higher number of bugs.

\caption{MSD for the active particles as a function of obstacle weight. An 
expected result where the MSD is lower when the obstacle weight is high. Since 
it is harder for the active particles to push heavy obstacles, they will then 
move less and this will lead to them having lower MSD. This same trend can be observed 
with different number of active particles in $\textbf{(a)}$, $\textbf{(b)}$, $\textbf{(c)}$ and $\textbf{(d)}$} 
\label{fig:msd_NW}
\end{figure}

This shows that while keeping the number of obstacles and number of bugs fixed, the 
MSD is lower for the cases with high obstacle weight, this result was expected 
since it is harder for the bugs to push heavier obstacles which will resulting in them 
having lower speed throughout the experiment. The weight of the obstacles is a parameter that is suppose to 
mimic the noise parameter in \cite{nilsson2017metastable} and to compare the result 
from this paper we can see in \cref{fig:simon_msd} that the curves is higher for the 
cases with low noise level $(\eta)$, similar with the experimental result in \cref{fig:msd_NW}.

For the last case of studying MSD as a function of obstacles density, the result is shown in 
\cref{fig:msd_NC}.

\caption{Here varying the obstacle density the MSD decreases when the obstacle density increases. 
Another expected result where the active particles have lesser space to move when the arena is 
filled with more obstacles. When the arena is packed with the number of obstacles as high as 
1000-1300 obstacles, the active particles will be significantly hindered and unable to move 
from their starting position, this leads to them having MSD close to zero throughout time $\tau$, 
see red and purple line in $\textbf{(b)}$, $\textbf{(c)}$ and $\textbf{(d)}$.} 
\label{fig:msd_NC}
\end{figure}

Here calculating the MSD of the active particles as a function of 
the obstacle density, it shows that the MSD is higher for the cases with low obstacle density and 
decreases as we increase the number of obstacles in the experiment. An expected result 
where less space is available for the active particles to move freely as the number 
of obstacles increases and particle-to-obstacle collisions is more frequent.


In the simulation done by \citeauthor{nilsson2017metastable} in \citetitle{nilsson2017metastable}, 
the active particles was studied as a function of orientational noise parameter. The resulting 
MSD using different noise level was shown in \cref{fig:simon_msd}, where the active particles 
transitioned from a diffusive state at a high noise level, to a superdiffusive state when the 
noise level is low. In the experiments here, the obstacle weight is the parameter that 
can best imitate the noise parameter from the simulation, where high noise level corresponds 
to high obstacle weight, and as seen already, the heavier 
the obstacles are, the lower is the MSD. We can visualize this result in terms of diffusion 
by plotting in loglog scale and do a linear regression shown in \cref{fig:msd_NW1100C15B_log}.


\begin{figure}[htpb]

	    $\alpha>1$ for the two lightest obstacle weights blue and orange lines, which

    \label{fig:msd_NW1100C15B_log}
\end{figure}

Similar to the result from \citeauthor{nilsson2017metastable}, \cref{fig:msd_NW1100C15B_log} shows that 
the active particles transition from a diffusive state at a high obstacle weight(red line) with $\alpha\leq1$ where 
MSD$(\tau)\propto\tau^{\alpha}$, to a superdiffusive state at a low obstacle weight(blue line) with $\alpha>1$. 


\section{Velocity}
To study how the weight of the obstacles affect the behavior of the active particles, 
it is desirable to maximize the interactions between the bugs and the obstacles. 
To achieve this, the experiment with 1200 obstacles and 25 bugs was chosen. The result 
of how the active particles velocity get affected by the weight of the obstacles is shown in 
\cref{fig:velkde_NW1200C25B}.

\begin{figure}[htpb]
    \centering
    \captionsetup{justification=centering,margin=2cm}
    \includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{figure/velocity/NW/NW1200C25B.png}
    \caption{Probability distribution of the active particles velocity depending on the 
    obstacle weight. All the four cases were done using 25 active 
    particles and 1200 obstacles, while the different obstacle weight cases has their 
    probability distribution peaks at velocity close to zero, the distribution for lower 
    obstacles weight has lower peak, slightly shifted to the right and also has a fatter tail. 
    Compare for example $m_{\text{passive}}=\SI{2e-3}{kg}$(blue) and $m_{\text{passive}}=\SI{17e-3}{kg}$(red).}
    \label{fig:velkde_NW1200C25B}
\end{figure}

Here all the cases were done using 25 active particles and with 1200 obstacles, while 
the weight of the obstacles varies in 4 cases, $m_{\text{passive}}=\SI{2e-3}{kg}$, 
$m_{\text{passive}}=\SI{7e-3}{kg}$, $m_{\text{passive}}=\SI{12e-3}{kg}$ and 
$m_{\text{passive}}=\SI{17e-3}{kg}$ producing the four different probability distribution.

What can be observed in \cref{fig:velkde_NW1200C25B} 
is that in all the cases, the probability distributions have similar shapes, peaking around $v\approx\SI{0}{\metre\per\second}$ 
and decrease as the velocity goes higher. Even though the similar shape of these distributions, 
one could see that at $v\approx\SI{0}{\metre\per\second}$, 
the peak of the distribution for lower obstacle weight is slightly lesser than the peak of higher obstacle weight. 
This result suggest that with a high obstacle density($N_{\text{passive}}=1200$), regardless of the obstacle weight, 
the velocity of the active particles will tend to 
be close to zero. However the probability of active particle having zero velocity is highest when using the heaviest obstacle, 
and as the obstacle weight decreases the bugs probability of having $v>\SI{0}{\metre\per\second}$ increases, according 
to the distributions in \cref{fig:velkde_NW1200C25B}.

One of the possible explanation of the similar distribution shapes, even though with different obstacle weights, is that when the arena
is packed with this many obstacles, close to its maximum packing density, the obstacles have less freedom to move 
when being pushed by the active particles. This leaves the active particles no options to move, neither 
by forming a channel nor changing direction to find a new path, leading to them being significantly 
slowed down or getting blocked by the obstacles, similar to a car in a traffic jam. 
Also the number of active particles, in these cases 25, 
may give rise to the situation of overcrowdedness where the active particles work against each other 
by blocking one another or closing already formed channels and thus preventing movements. 
With this high packing density and high number of active particles, regardless of the weight of the 
obstacles, the movement of the active particles will be minimal which leads to velocity close to zero.

Even though the arena hasn't yet reached its maximum capacity in how many obstacles that can be fit in, 
with a high obstacle density such as 1200 obstacles, the steady state behavior will be similar regardless 
of the obstacle weight, which is the active particles being hindered by the obstacles. However, in shorter time periods for example 
10 to 20 seconds, there are noticeable differences between the cases of different obstacle weight, as shown in \cref{fig:snapshot_0020}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

{\includegraphics[width=.4\textwidth]{figure/velocity/snapshot/3W1300C25B_snapshot_0020_ipe.PNG}}

\caption{Snapshot of two experiments both at $\unit[20]{s}$. Both experiments 
was done using 25 active particles and with 1300 obstacles wherein \textbf{(a)} the obstacle 
weigh is $m_{\text{passive}}=\SI{2e-3}{kg}$ each, and in 
\textbf{(b)} $m_{\text{passive}}=\SI{17e-3}{kg}$ each. The trajectories of the active particles in 
red lines shows that at the begining in \textbf{(a)}, the active particles were able to form and/or 
reuse channels for a short time, while in \textbf{(b)} the active particles remain more or less confined
in the same region from where they started.} \label{fig:snapshot_0020}
\end{figure}

Seeing the two cases side-by-side one can notice the obvious differences where the case in \cref{fig:0W1300C25B_0020}, after letting 
the active particles run for $\unit[20]{s}$ they've manage to move the obstacles aside and form 
some noticeable channels. This activity of forming channels and moving through them last for 
some seconds and afterwards the majority of the active particles will return to being 
hindered again, either by pushing a large block of obstacles or by blocking each other and preventing movements.

In \cref{fig:3W1300C25B_0020} the active particles will immediately be hindered by the heavy obstacles right from the start,
and will spend almost all of their time standing still from being blocked and confined by the obstacles.
from pushing the heavy obstacles of $\SI{17e-3}{kg}$ each, leaving all of them 
with velocities close to zero.

Having seen the results above, one would wonder what happens when the packing density and the number 
bugs is lower, will there be more noticeable differences between the different obstacle weight? Below in \cref{fig:velkde_NWNC10B} shows 
probability distributions of 4 different packing densities with 100, 400, 700, 1000 obstacles.

\caption{Probability distributions of the active particles velocity at 4 different obstacle density. 
Each figure has 4 distributions corresponding to the different obstacle weight while the number of active particles is fixed to 10. 
At a high obstacle density case in \textbf{(d)}, the probability $p(v>0)$ for heavier obstacle cases (red, green and orange) is close to zero. 
The lightest obstacle weight case in blue has its distribution peak significantly lower than the other cases and with a fatter tail, this 
suggest the situation shown \cref{fig:snapshot_0020} where the active particle are able to move more at this obstacle weight. 
In \textbf{(c)} show clearly how the different obstacle weight affect the active particles velocity where, the distribution becomes 
narrower and shift towards zero velocity as the obstacles becomes heavier.} 
\label{fig:velkde_NWNC10B}
\end{figure}

The clearest case that shows how the weight of the obstacles affect the velocities of the active particles is 
the case of 700 obstacles in \cref{fig:velkde_NW700C10B}. Here the distribution shift to the left and gets narrower as the 
obstacle weight increases, with $\SI{17e-3}{kg}$(red) having highest peak at $v\approx\SI{0}{\metre\per\second}$, followed by $\SI{12e-3}{kg}$(green), 
$\SI{7e-3}{kg}$(orange) and $\SI{2e-3}{kg}$(blue). This result show how the active particles is being slowed down 
depending on the obstacle weight, where their velocity is lower in an environment of heavier obstacles. 

%t99Here all the cases with different obstacle weights 
%shows a peak around $v\approx\SI{0}{\metre\per\second}$, while the peak is higher and narrower for the case of high obstacle 
%weight suggesting less movement of the active particles in an environment of heavy obstacles. For the rest of the cases 
%with $m_{\text{passive}}=\SI{12e-3}{kg}$, $m_{\text{passive}}=\SI{7e-3}{kg}$ and $m_{\text{passive}}=\SI{2e-3}{kg}$, they all have highest
%probability of having low velocity, but this probability gets lower as the obstacle weight decreases, see \cref{fig:velhist_NW1100C25B_2}. 
%Lets instead look at the overall shape of the velocity distribution $p(v)$ for the cases with lower obstacle density in 
%\cref{fig:velhist_NW600C25B,fig:velhist_NW400C25B,fig:velhist_NW100C25B}.

At lower obstacle densities cases in \cref{fig:velkde_NW100C10B,fig:velkde_NW400C10B} the range of allowed 
velocities that the bugs can take seems to be larger i.e. there is nonzero probability for higher velocity, 
and there is high probability around $v\approx\SI{0.2}{\metre\per\second}$. 
For these cases(\cref{fig:velkde_NW100C10B,fig:velkde_NW400C10B}) the overall qualitative behavior of the active 
particles is barely affected by the different obstacle weights, since the interactions between 
the passive- and active particles are minimal when the packing density is low. 

So an observation that can be made from the results in \cref{fig:velkde_NWNC10B} is that when the packing density 
is too low, there is no clear pattern of how the different obstacle weights effect the velocities of the 
active particles. The threshold of ''too low'' packing density is found to be about less than \num{500} obstacles. 
On the other hand, when having high packing density where $N_{\text{passive}}\gg N_{\text{active}}$, the different obstacle weights doesn't have a 
significant effect on the active particles, since at a high packing density, e.g. more than \num{1200} obstacles, 
regardless of the obstacle weight, the movement of the active particles will be minimal leaving their 
average velocity close to zero, as shown in \cref{fig:mean_velocity}

	    The fact that the blue line doesn't converge with the other lines can also be visualized in \textbf{(b)} 
	    where the lightest obstacle case(blue) has its distribution peak much lower and also has a fatter tail, at this 
	    high packing density.
    }
    \label{fig:mean_velocity}
\end{figure}

As can be seen in \cref{fig:mean_velocity_obstacles} the active particles average velocity decreases as the number 
of obstacles increases. How fast this velocity decreases does depend on the obstacles weight where heavier obstacles 
leads to fastest decrease in velocity, see \cref{fig:mean_velocity_obstacles}. At a high packing density at about 
\num{1200} obstacles and higher, the lines corresponding to the three heaviest obstacle weights, red, green and orange, 
converges at the same low velocity. The blue line corresponding to the lightest obstacle weight stays at a higher velocity 
which suggest the scenario mentioned in \cref{fig:snapshot_0020}. 

%99when $N_{\text{obstacles}}\lesssim500$ obstacles, here the mean 
%velocity of the active particles corresponding to different obstacle weight doesn't follow any 
%particular pattern. However when $500\lesssim N_{\text{obstacles}}\lesssim1100$, a pattern emerges where the mean velocity 
%is higher for the case of lower obstacle weight. And when $N_{\text{obstacles}}\gtrsim1100$ the 
%mean velocity for different cases seems to converge to a low value close to zero. Shown in \cref{fig:velkde_NW1200C25B} 
%is the case with highest obstacle density of 1300 obstacles, where the velocity distribution of the active particles takes 
%similar shape, peaking at zero velocity, independent of the obstacle weight. To generalize this behaviour

%\begin{align}
%    \begin{array}{lr}
%        \langle\bm{v}_{\unit[2]{g}}\rangle\approx
%        \langle\bm{v}_{\unit[7]{g}}\rangle\approx

%    \end{array}
%    \label{eq:mean_velocity_boundary}
%\end{align}

%where $L$ and $U$ are lower and upper boundary of the number of obstacles to which the 
%character of the mean velocity changes. The velocity $v_{\text{max}}$ is the velocity 
%that the active particles have when moving freely without obstacles, $N_{\text{obstacles}}$ 
%is the number of obstacles and $\langle\bm{v}\rangle$ is an average done over number 
%of frames and number of active particles and the subscripts $\SI{2}{g}$, $\SI{7}{g}$, 
%$\SI{12}{g}$ and $\SI{17}{g}$ correspond to the obstacle weight. See \cref{theory_velocity} to see how the velocity 
%is calculated and how the average is done. The specific values for the lower boundary $L$ and 
%the upper boundary $U$ do depend on the number of active particles that were used. 
%In the specific case of 15 active particles in \cref{fig:mean_velocity_obstacles_15B}, the 
%boundaries are $L\approx500$ and $U\approx1100$ obstacles. The boundaries for the different number of

%    \label{fig:LU}
%\end{figure}

%Again the boundaries $L$ and $U$ show the number of obstacles to which 
%the mean velocity of the active particles changes its behaviour. The 
%lower boundary $L$ is a qualitative threshold measured in number of obstacles, 
%where if the number of obstacles is lesser than this threshold the velocity 
%of the active particles will not get noticeably affected by the 
%different obstacle weights and the mean velocity of the active particles 
%will be approximately the same for different obstacle weights. When $N_{\text{obstacles}}\lesssim L$ the area 
%filled with obstacles is sparse and the interaction between active particles 
%and obstacles is minimal and the weight of the obstacles do not have a significant effect on the active particles. 
%As for the upper boundary $U$, when the number of obstacles is higher than 
%this boundary, $N_{\text{obstacles}}\gtrsim U$, the arena is packed so dense with 
%obstacles that the active particles will have a hard time to move and will 
%have a mean velocity close to zero independent of the weight of the obstacles, see \cref{fig:velhist_NW1300C25B}.
%Now the case of $L\lesssim N_{\text{obstacles}}\lesssim U$ when the number of obstacles 
%is in a region between the lower and the upper boundary, this is where the mean 
%velocity of the active particles follows a pattern where the mean velocity is higher 
%for the case of low obstacle weight, and lower velocity for heavier obstacle weight, see 
%\cref{fig:mean_velocity_obstacles_15B} where $L\approx500$ and $U\approx1100$.99 

%One observation that can be made from \cref{tab:LU} and \cref{fig:LU} is that as the number of active particle 
%increases, the lower and the upper boundary $L$ and $U$ seem to also increase. This observation 
%seems to suggest that there is some optimal ratio for the number of active particles and the 
%number of obstacles, which leads to a particle-obstacle interaction that is noticeably affected 
%by the obstacle weight.

Previously, the results show that when having the number of active particles fixed, 
the mean velocity for these active particles decrease towards zero as the number of 
obstacles increases. As for the weight of the obstacles as a parameter, 
the mean velocity of the active particles is higher at a low obstacle weight 
and the velocity is lower when the obstacle weight is high. 

A question that needs to be answered is how does the number of active particles 
affect their mean velocity? Lets answer this by looking at the case where 
the obstacle weight is $m_{\text{passive}}=\SI{7e-3}{kg}$, as shown in \cref{fig:velkde_1WNCNB}.

%\caption{Probability distributions of the active particles velocity at four different obstacle density. Each

%1200 obstacles. This shift of the distribution peak happens fastest for the case of $N_{\text{active}}=25$, see 
%\textbf{(c)}(blue line), and follows by the other cases in the order of high to low number of active particles.} 
%\label{fig:4velhist_0W}
%\end{figure}

As pointed out earlier, the active particles velocity decreases as the number of obstacles increases. This 
again can be seen in \cref{fig:velkde_1WNCNB} where the peaks of the velocity distributions shifts towards $v=0$ 
as the number of obstacles increases from $N_{\text{passive}}=100$, in \cref{fig:velkde_1W100CNB}, to 
$N_{\text{passive}}=1300$, in \cref{fig:velkde_1W1300CNB}.

When having a closer look at how the number of active particles is affecting the behavior, such as the case with 
low obstacle density in \cref{fig:velkde_1W100CNB} with $N_{\text{passive}}=100$, there is a clear separation 
between the different velocity distributions where the distribution for higher number of active particles peaks 
at a lower velocity(red), and the distributions shifts towards higher velocity as the number of active particles decreases(blue).
This result shows that the probability of having a lower ensemble velocity is higher when the number of active particles 
is high.

%99there are clear velocity distribution peaks for the low number active particles cases, 
%$N_{\text{active}}=1$(red) and $N_{\text{active}}=5$(green) at velocity $v=\SI{2e-4}{\metre\per\second}$ respective $v=\SI{2.5e-3}{\metre\per\second}$, as seen in \cref{fig:velhist_0W100CNB}. With cases of high number active particles, 
%$N_{\text{active}}=15$(orange) and $N_{\text{active}}=25$(blue), there velocity distribution peaks are comparatively 
%lower, around this nonzero velocity, than the two other cases of low number active particles. Now looking at $v\approx\SI{0}{\metre\per\second}$ 
%again in \cref{fig:velhist_0W100CNB}, the case with $N_{\text{active}}=25$(blue) shows highest density peak close to zero velocity i.e.
%the probability is higher for the active particles to have low velocity when the number of active particles is high.


%When the packing density increases as in \cref{fig:velhist_0W300CNB,fig:velhist_0W800CNB}, with 
%$N_{\text{passive}}=300$ and $N_{\text{passive}}=800$, some sort of pattern emerges. The velocity distributions 
%shift to the left towards $v=\SI{0}{\metre\per\second}$ with $N_{\text{active}}=25$(blue line) leading, followed 
%by the other cases in the order of decreasing number of active particles, as seen in \cref{fig:velhist_0W800CNB}.
%This particular result shown in \cref{fig:velhist_0W800CNB}, differentiate all the four cases of different number 
%of active particles showing that the probability of having a high velocity do decrease as the number of active particles increase.

This suggest some sort of crowdedness where the large amount of active particles hinders each 
other from moving by creating some sort of congestion, see an example in \cref{fig:0W300C25B_congestion}. 
As the number of obstacles increases further as in \cref{fig:velkde_1W1300CNB}, 
all the distributions peaks at a velocity close to zero, regardless of the number of active particles. Similar to this result 
has been seen before in \cref{fig:mean_velocity_obstacles} where the velocities of the active particles converge towards zero, 
independent of the obstacle weight, as the packing density increases.

\label{fig:0W300C25B_congestion}
\end{figure}



This hindering behavior in \cref{fig:0W300C25B_congestion} happens more frequently as the number of active particles increases, and 
as a consequence, the ensemble mean velocity of the active particles decreases when this happens. 

%Having seen how the velocity distribution of the active particles depend on the the number of active particles, in 
%\cref{fig:4velhist_0W}, with $m_{\text{passive}}=\SI{2e-3}{kg}$ at different obstacle density. 
The differences that was seen when observing the active particles velocity as a function of number active particles is that, 
higher number of active particles leads to a velocity distribution peak at a lower velocity, 
and the explanation being, because of the stage being overpopulated with active particles, they hinder each other from moving 
as in \cref{fig:0W300C25B_congestion} which in turn leads to them having low velocity.

%99To further investigate the number of active particles as a parameter, the velocity distributions with 
%heavier obstacle weights is shown in \cref{fig:4velhist_1W,fig:4velhist_2W,fig:4velhist_3W}.

%\end{figure}


%As already been seen with $m_{\text{passive}}=\SI{2e-3}{kg}$ in \cref{fig:4velhist_0W}, the general observation  
%regarding how the number of active particles is affecting their velocity, is that higher number of active 
%particles leads to them having lower velocity. This can also be observe in cases with higher obstacle weight 
%in \cref{fig:velhist_1W200CNB,fig:velhist_2W200CNB,fig:velhist_3W100CNB}, where at low obstacle density, 
%the velocity distribution peaks at a value between $\SI{1}{\metre\per\second}\lesssim v \lesssim\SI{3}{\metre\per\second}$. 
%And as before, the distributions for cases with higher number of active particles has either lower peaks at these 
%nonzero velocity, or their distribution peaks is shifted towards lower velocity.

%As the packing density increases, there are two things that can be observed. First is what was already seen in \cref{fig:velhist_0W300CNB,fig:velhist_0W800CNB}, 
%where the velocity distributions shifts towards $v=\SI{0}{\metre\per\second}$ leading with cases of high number 
%of active particles, followed by lower number of active particles cases, as seen in \cref{fig:velhist_1W800CNB,fig:velhist_2W500CNB}.
%This suggest that while increasing the number of obstacles, the motion of the active particles becomes more limited and 
%slower. Moreover this effect of slowing down the active particles by the obstacles is more prevalent when there are 
%more active particles on the stage.

%It is so far clear how the obstacle density affect the overall behaviour of the active particles in the extreme cases, 
%with high obstacle density e.g. close to $N_{\text{passive}}=1300$, resulting in the active particles having low velocity close to zero, 
%while low obstacle density leads to a higher velocity. Though this is true regardless of the obstacle weight, see \cref{fig:mean_velocity}, 
%or the number of active particles, see \cref{fig:velhist_0W1200CNB,fig:velhist_1W1000CNB,fig:velhist_2W900CNB,fig:velhist_3W800CNB}, 
%this transition from nonzero velocity to close-to-zero velocity happens faster with higher obstacle weight. The probability density 
%of the active particles velocity shows a noticeable peak around $\SI{1}{\metre\per\second}\lesssim v \lesssim\SI{3}{\metre\per\second}$, 
%when the obstacle density is low, see \cref{fig:velhist_0W100CNB,fig:velhist_1W200CNB,fig:velhist_2W200CNB,fig:velhist_3W100CNB}. 
%This velocity density peaks then shift to $v\approx\SI{0}{\metre\per\second}$ when having high obstacle density, see 
%\cref{fig:velhist_0W1200CNB,fig:velhist_1W1000CNB,fig:velhist_2W900CNB,fig:velhist_3W800CNB}. This transition happens 
%fastest with the case where $m_{\text{passive}}=\SI{17e-3}{kg}$(\cref{fig:4velhist_3W}) and $m_{\text{passive}}=\SI{12e-3}{kg}$(\cref{fig:4velhist_2W}), within only 700 obstacles. 
%While for lighter obstacle cases, this transition happens in 800 obstacles for $m_{\text{passive}}=\SI{7e-3}{kg}$(\cref{fig:4velhist_1W}) and 
%in 1100 obstacles for $m_{\text{passive}}=\SI{2e-3}{kg}$(\cref{fig:4velhist_0W}), see \cref{fig:4velhist_0W,fig:4velhist_1W,fig:4velhist_2W,fig:4velhist_3W}.

%The transition of the velocity distribution mentioned above involves a situation where there are peaks around two certain velocities 
%at the same time. In many cases, the velocity distribution peaks close to $v=\SI{0}{\metre\per\second}$, but at some obstacle density, 
%there will appear some peaks at a higher velocities, often somewhere between 
%$\SI{1}{\metre\per\second}\lesssim v \lesssim\SI{3}{\metre\per\second}$, clearly seen in \cref{fig:velhist_0W800CNB,fig:velhist_1W600CNB,fig:velhist_2W500CNB,fig:velhist_3W500CNB}.


%The peak of the velocity distribution at about zero velocity is due to the fact that the active particles spend time 
%pushing obstacles or colliding into each other resulting in them having low velocity. On the other hand, 
%the peak at higher velocities is due to the active particles moving unhindered through already formed channels. 

%As the packing density increase even more, the peak of the velocity distribution at higher velocities will disappear 
%leaving only distributions peaks at $v\approx\SI{0}{\metre\per\second}$, as can be seen in 
%\cref{fig:velhist_0W1200CNB,fig:velhist_1W1000CNB,fig:velhist_2W900CNB,fig:velhist_3W800CNB}.99
Regarding the number of obstacles, there is a strong intuition already about how this parameter 
should affect the active particles motion, after having seen the result before. 
The intuition is that the active particles velocity should decrease as the number of obstacles increases. 
We confirm this with \cref{fig:velkde_1WNC10B}


\begin{figure}[htpb]
    \centering
    \captionsetup{justification=centering,margin=2cm}
    \includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{figure/velocity/NC/1WNC10B.png}
    \caption{Active particles probability distribution as a function of obstacle density. 
	    The distribution shift to the left towards $v=0$ as the the number of obstacles increases, 
	    an expected result since the active particles has less space to move on when the arena 
	    is filled with many obstacles.
    }
    \label{fig:velkde_1WNC10B}
\end{figure}

Having shortly discussed before, the scenario where the obstacle weight do not have any significant 
effect on the active particles when the number of obstacles is low. The explanation was that when the 
obstacle density is too sparse, then the interaction between active particles and obstacles will be minimal, 
resulting in the different obstacle weight having no distinguishable effect on the active particle. 
Though intuition suggest that there certainly are differences between a bug colliding with a heavy object
in oppose to a light object. Hitting a heavy object, the rod shaped bugs should ''bounce'' off changing 
its direction more rapidly than when hitting a light object. 

To investigate this, the orientational changes of the bugs in terms angular velocity are being used, 
to see if their behavior is expected and how do their orientation gets affected by different parameter. 
The angular velocity is the change of orientation per time unit and can be expressed as

\begin{align}
    \omega =& \dfrac{d\theta}{dt}
\end{align}

where $\omega$ is the angular velocity in unit $\si{\radian\per\second}$, $\theta$ is the orientation 
measured in $\si{\radian}$. In \cref{fig:angvelkde_NW600C10B} shows how the obstacle weight affect 
the angular velocity of the active particles.  





%In many experiments while visualizing how the angular velocity $\omega$ change with the obstacle weight 
%$m_{\text{passive}}$, there seems to show no trend of how different obstacle weight might affect the angular velocity, since 
%most of the distributions of the angular velocity has their peaks around $\omega\approx\SI{0}{\radian\per\second}$. 
%There are though some case where the angular velocity do change with the obstacle weight. For example the case of 
%$N_{\text{passive}}=100$ and $N_{\text{active}}=1$ with varying obstacle weight, in \cref{fig:angvel_NW100C1B} 


\begin{figure}[htpb!]

	    has a higher peak compared to the heavier one(red).
    }
    \label{fig:angvelkde_NW600C10B}
\end{figure}

As can be observed in \cref{fig:angvelkde_NW600C10B}, most of the cases has their peaks 
at $d\theta/dt\approx\SI{0}{\radian\per\second}$ while for $m_{\text{passive}}=\SI{2e-3}{kg}$(blue) 
the distribution is peak is higher than for $m_{\text{passive}}=\SI{17e-3}{kg}$(red). This 
suggest that there is a higher probability for the active particles to change their orientation 
in an environment of heavy obstacles, more than light obstacles. This points to what was mentioned 
earlier about the nature of the collisions between active and passive particles. 
When the active particles collide with a heavy obstacle, the active particle will ''bounce off'' 
and change direction more abruptly, similar mechanics as in elastic collisions. In contrast 
with the scenario where the active particles collide with a light obstacle, they instead 
push the obstacle forward for a short distance before going their own way again. 

Finally the angular velocity as a function of obstacle density and number of active particles is 
shown in \cref{fig:angvelkde_1WNCNB}

} 
\label{fig:angvelkde_1WNCNB}
\end{figure}

Somewhat expected result in \cref{fig:angvelkde_1WNCNB}, since it was already observed when 
studying the velocity where the velocity tend to be lower as the number of obstacles and the 
number of active particles increases. Similar pattern holds also for the angular velocity.

%99Regarding how the angular velocity changes as a function of the number of active particles, 
%there is no noticeable trend and most of the cases has their angular velocity distribution peaks around zero. 
%Lastly when analysing the angular velocity of the active particles as a function of the number of 
%obstacles, most of the distributions peaks at zero, see for example in \cref{fig:angvel_2WNC10B}

%\end{figure}

%where the angular velocity of the active particles is shown as a function of the obstacle density, $N_{\text{passive}}$. 
%Although, here in \cref{fig:angvel_2WNC10B}, the angular velocity distributions have peaks at zero for all the different

%the distribution for high obstacle densities such as 
%$N_{\text{passive}}=1300$(yellow) and $N_{\text{passive}}=900$(blue), is narrower than of lower obstacle densities like
%$N_{\text{passive}}=100$(red) or $N_{\text{passive}}=500$(green). This could be due to the fact that the active particles
%has less freedom to turn i.e. change its orientation when the arena is highly packed with heavy obstacles, which 
%would give rise to the high and narrow peak. In contrast the wider peak from the case of low obstacle density is 
%when the active particle have more space to move around and turn without much constraints from the obstacles.99

\section{Collective Behaviours} \label{collective_behaviors}

One of the main focus of this paper was to design a macroscale system in a way to provide the conditions for 
collective behaviors to emerge. To be more specific, we want to observe cooperative behaviors such as, 
active particles forming and reusing channels. Though this particular behavior is not the only cooperative behavior 
since any other behaviors/interactions between the active particles that are mutually beneficial can 
be classified as cooperative behavior. In our case, it is natural to define the goal for the active 
particles as maximizing their movements.

In the experiments, there were some frequently occurring behaviors with the bugs that was difficult to quantify. 
The easiest way was to do a qualitative observation by watching the recorded footage of the experiments.  
Some of these behaviors occurs more frequent than others and may seem trivial. In this section, 
different observed behaviors will be presented. 

One behavior that happens in almost all the experiments is where the bugs become stuck at the boundary edges of the 
arena, see \cref{fig:boundary}. This was a big issue with the two previous designs of the border where we first had a rectangular 
border with $90^\circ$ corners(right boundary in \cref{fig:boundary} without the rounded corners) and the bugs kept getting 
stuck at these sharp corners. The second iteration had 
rounded corners which remove the issue of the first design but still have the problem of which the bugs 
would spend most of the time traversing the edges of the stage instead of interacting with the obstacles 
inside the stage. The current design which is the cloudy border would minimize these two previous problems, 
but the getting ''stuck'' behavior still occur, but for different reasons. For the first two border designs 
the bugs were getting stuck mainly because of the chirality of there movements in combination with the border 
design of straight edges with rounded or sharp corners. The chirality of these robots was a random property that 
could not be controlled in before hand, also given the fact that the robots are suppose to be toys for children, 
this unexpected property was no surprise. 

With the current ''cloudy'' border(left model in \cref{fig:boundary}) the bugs are instead 
getting stuck when they are going against each other in the opposite direction and they are in some sort 
of equilibrium where the forces from each bugs in different directions balance out and the group of bugs stay still 
for some seconds until the equilibrium breaks and each bugs go their own way again. Of course the chirality of the 
bugs and the stage design still plays a role in this but it is not obvious as in the previous two border designs. 
Some example of bugs getting stuck is shown in \cref{fig:BB}.

The situation shown in \cref{fig:BB} is an example of the active particles working against each other by preventing 
each other from moving. This behavior can be categorised as ''Anti Cooperative Behaviour'' i.e. some collective 
behavior that minimize the active particles movement, as oppose to Cooperative behavior where the bugs 
help each other to maximize the groups movements.

There are many scenarios where cooperative behavior occurs where the bugs assist each other to move in 
various ways, some easier to observed than others. Here some cases of cooperative behavior will be presented. 
With regard of the restrictions of this format, only the cases that can be clearly visualized will be presented. 
The first example is shown in \cref{fig:CBPO}.

\caption{Three different examples of cooperative behavior showing how the bugs assist one another 
to push away obstacles. It would take much longer time without other bugs helping. 
The direction of the bugs is marked with black arrows.}
\label{fig:CBPO}
\end{figure}


Here the bugs assist each other to push away some obstacles from the border of the arena, 
and thus making way for other bugs to move freely at the edges. The observation in \cref{fig:CBPO} 
is taken from three different experiments where in each experiment four consecutive frames are taken showing how the bugs move. 
Note that in these examples shown, the assistance of other bugs that were not initially pushing 
the obstacles do make a significant difference in moving them, either by speeding up the process or 
clearing out a bigger area of obstacles.

Next example is when the bugs are pushing onto each other preventing the scenario where some bugs 
are being blocked and confined by obstacles.

\caption{Examples of cooperative behavior where one 
bug push another bug that is being blocked, to move forward. When facing an obstacle one single bug might not be strong 
enough to move the obstacles in front, but when another bug join, they are able to together push the obstacle away 
making channels for other bugs.
} 
\label{fig:CBP}
\end{figure}


As for the case of cooperative behavior shown i \cref{fig:CBP}, where a push bug push another 
bug, the outcome where the pushing bug successfully push another bug from its unmovable position 
doesn't always happen. When the obstacle weight is too high and if there are too many obstacle 
in front of the bugs, both the bugs will become stuck. With that said, when two bugs do collide 
they tend to change each others movement in some way and thus destroy whatever equilibrium they 
were in, which will create more movements.

The motivation of categorising the above behaviors in \cref{fig:CBPO,fig:CBP} as 
''Cooperative behaviors'' can be put as follows. Since 
the aim of this project is to study the collective behaviors of these agents, 
and to do so, these agents have to ''behave'' in some way, and behaving in 
this particular case is almost synonymous with moving. Moving particles thus give 
interesting and non-trivial data for analysis, compared to a particle standing still 
from being blocked. So any action, from a particle onto another one, that increase the 
ensemble displacement will be considered as cooperative behavior.


Now the next reoccurring behavior, which is shown in \cref{fig:CMC}, is when the bugs 
create a circular shaped channel and keep reusing it, circling inside for many lapses. 


\begin{figure}[htpb!]
\centering
\subfloat[7 lapses\label{fig:CMC_0W1200C15B_a}]

{\includegraphics[width=.30\textwidth]{figure/CMC/1W1000C20B/1W1000C20B_CMC_post.png}}
\caption{Examples where the bugs are circling inside a circle shaped channel for many lapses. 
The bugs might end up in this situation coming from other channels, and due to its chirality 
they might circle around for some lapse before moving on through nearby channels. In 
some cases while the bugs are circling, other bugs might push and move the obstacles adding 
walls to this circular shaped channels making them more stable. This leads to the bugs inside, 
the fully closed circular channel, traversing around for many lapses, as seen in \textbf{(a)} and \textbf{(b)}.} 
\label{fig:CMC}
\end{figure}

This circling behavior is presented in the four examples, \cref{fig:CMC_0W1200C15B_a,fig:CMC_1W800C10B_b,fig:CMC_1W800C15B_c,fig:CMC_1W1000C20B_d}, 
with the trajectories of the bugs marked in red and the number of lapses of which the bugs are circling around. 

This type of ''local'' channel i.e. not expanding over a large area of the arena, tend to be more stable 
than the channels that extend over a larger area. The reason for this is that for the latter type of 
channel, the likelihood of another bug cutting through and destroy the channel is higher. 
These circular shaped channels are mostly formed between rigid boundary from the stage(\cref{fig:boundary}) 
and obstacles, this means that 
a portion of the channel will be immovable part supported by the rigid bounday, and the movable part formed 
by the obstacles. This will decrease the chance of channels being destroyed since it is partly immovable.

Now the duration of the bugs circling in these channels will depend on how much of the channel 
consist of the rigid boundary, which is immovable by the bugs. In \cref{fig:CMC_0W1200C15B_a}, the bug manage to stay in 
the channel for 7 lapses compared to the case in \cref{fig:CMC_1W800C15B_c}, which is only 2 lapses. 
One could immediately see the differences in these two channels where in the first case a big segment 
of the channel constitute of the rigid boundary made by wood, roughly two-thirds of the channel. Whereas the latter 
case where the bug only circle for 2 lapses, this channel constitute mostly of obstacles and empty spaces, 
roughly two-third of the channel being movable and one-third immovable, this will increase the likelihood 
of the bug destroying or escaping the channel. 

Generally the channels tend to be quite unstable, especially the ones that cover a large area of 
the stage consisting only of obstacles and no rigid boundaries. Every time a bug uses a channel it moves 
the obstacles slightly, and after many usages, the channel is destroyed, this phenomena is faster for 
lighter obstacles and when there are many bugs on the stage.

An example of the type of channel that stretches across the stage is shown in \cref{fig:CM_0W900C10B}.

\begin{figure}[htpb!]
\centering
\subfloat{\includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{figure/CM/0W900C10B/0W900C10B_CM_post_1.png}}
\caption{A bug propagating through a long channel that stretches over the stage, 
startin from the upper left corner going to the lower right corner.
This experiment was done with $N_{\text{active}}=10$, $N_{\text{passive}}=900$ and 
$m_{\text{passive}}=\SI{2e-3}{kg}$. The trajectory of where the bug traverses along the 
channel is marked with a dashed red line, the start of the trajectory is marked as $\vdash$ and the 
end with $\rightarrow$. The bug that traverses this trajectory is marked with a black dot.} 
\label{fig:CM_0W900C10B}
\end{figure}

Again, these type of channel shown in \cref{fig:CM_0W900C10B} tend to be unstable with 
reasons mentioned before. Compared to the circular shaped channels shown in \cref{fig:CMC}, these long type 
are quite exposed to other bugs destroying it, by either pushing away the obstacles that make up the walls of the channels 
or moving some obstacles into the channel and thus blocking the channel. 

With only 10 bugs in this experiment, in \cref{fig:CM_0W900C10B}, it is relatively easy to spot when a channel is 
being created, reuse and destroyed. When the number of bugs is higher than this, the 
stage gets somewhat cluttered which makes it harder to spot a channel and also the 
high number of bugs will raise the likelihood of a channel being destroyed.

With only one bug, it is easier to track its behavior, as seen in \cref{fig:CM_0W1000C1B}.

$m_{\text{passive}}=\SI{2e-3}{kg}$. The trajectory of where the bug traverses along the

end with $\rightarrow$. The bug that traverses this trajectory is marked with a black dot.} 
\label{fig:CM_0W1000C1B}
\end{figure}

In this one bug case it is easy to spot the moment when the bug is using a channel and 
some part of the channel last relatively long since there is no other bug that can 
destroy the channel. The channels that are formed in the experiments with low 
number of bugs and high obstacle density tend to be longer in distance and more 
stable i.e. stay intact for a longer period of time. This can be visualized 
in \cref{fig:CM_0W1000C1B_1,fig:CM_0W1000C1B_2,fig:CM_0W1000C1B_3}, where 
the overall appearance of the stage, with the preexisting channels, looks 
close to identical. In the one bug example, in \cref{fig:CM_0W1000C1B} the duration 
for with the bug to reuse the different channels spans from $t_{\text{duration}}=\SI{4}{\second}$ 
to $t_{\text{duration}}=\SI{11}{\second}$, which are some of the longest duration observed 
amongst the different experiments regarding channel behaviors.

Another type of situation where several bugs reuse the same channel is presented in \cref{fig:CM_0W900C25B}.

\begin{figure}[htpb!]

end with $\rightarrow$. The bugs that traverse the red trajectory are marked with black dots.} 
\label{fig:CM_0W900C25B}
\end{figure}


With the one bug example in \cref{fig:CM_0W1000C1B}, its behavior can be deduced by looking at the time 
evolution of its velocity $v$, reported in \cref{fig:CM_0W1000C1B_vt}.

 data is too noisy to make any qualitative judgements.} 
\label{fig:CM_0W1000C1B_vt}
\end{figure}

In this figure it can seen that the velocity is fluctuating between minima- and maxima values. 
As expected the minimas marked  \textbf{(a)} and \textbf{(d)} connects to the situations 
where the bug is being blocked by trying to penetrate through the obstacles. The maximas marked in 
\textbf{(b)} and \textbf{(c)} is the scenario where the bug moves unhindered through a channel.

As expected the points with low velocity, \textbf{(a)} and \textbf{(d)} in 
\cref{fig:CM_0W1000C1B_vt}, relates to when the bug is being blocked by obstacles, which are the scenarios 
in \cref{fig:0W1000C1B_vt_refer_a,fig:0W1000C1B_vt_refer_d}. The 
two velocity maximas \textbf{(b)} and \textbf{(c)} shows instead that the bug is 
traversing through a channel unhindered which \cref{fig:0W1000C1B_vt_refer_b,fig:0W1000C1B_vt_refer_c}
confirms.

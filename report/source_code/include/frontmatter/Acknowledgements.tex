\section*{Acknowledgements}
Many people have contributed to this project and first and foremost I would like to give credit to 
Giovanni Volpe for proposing this project and being my supervisor and examiner. I would also like to thank 
Alessandro Maguzz√∫ for helping out with many of the practical side of the project, giving good advises 
and suggestions steering the project in the right direction. This project wouldn't be possible 
without Filip Dahlsbecker's and Mokhtar Mapar's contribution with their expertise and resources of 3D printing. 
I am also grateful to Quentin Pikeroen with his assistance and input to the project, both the experimental 
and the analysis part, and also for putting up with the long experiments.
Lastly I would like to thank all the people in Soft Matter Lab for their kindness and encouragement 
providing a pleasant environment through the course of this thesis.

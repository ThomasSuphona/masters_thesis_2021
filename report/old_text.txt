Introduction 

	With many particle systems, one of the most interesting aspects is the complex collective behaviors that emerge. 
	In nature, this behavior can be observed in, schools of fish moving as a unit, flocks 
	of birds flying uniformly as group, herd of land animals and even human crowds. These phenomena are fascinating 
	to observe and study because the mechanisms behind the collective behaviors are far from obvious. 
	%This remarkable feature of equilibrium systems has been studied in great detail for the last couple of decades and 
	%concepts like scaling, universality, and renormalization have resulted in systematic picture of a wide range of systems 
	%in physics\cite{vicsek1995novel, stanley1971phase}.
	Collective behaviours, as a feature of systems, have been studied in great detail for the last decades. This has 
	provided concepts like scaling and universality, which have resulted in a systematic picture and deeper 
	understanding of a wide range of systems in physics\cite{vicsek1995novel, stanley1971phase}.

	%When studying these multiple-particle systems, it is preferable to refer them as brownian particles and there 
	%are two types, active and passive brownian particles. 
	In litteratures it is common to conceptionalize the elements of these multiple-particle systems as brownian particles. 
	The two types of brownian particles are active brownian particles and passive brownian particles.
	Active brownian particles, also known as microswimmers\cite{volpe2014simulation}, 
	in contrast of passive brownian particles, are capable of taking up energy from their environment and converting 
	it into directed motion\cite{bechinger2016active, ebbens2010pursuit}. These active particles are biological or manmade microscopic and 
	nanoscopic objects that are capable of self-propusion. This ability of self-propulsion is a common feature in 
	microorganisms\cite{lauga2009hydrodynamics, cates2012diffusive, poon2013clarkia}, which allows the organisms for a 
	more efficient way to search for nutrients or avoid toxic substances\cite{viswanathan2011physics}. 
	In the biological realm, examples of active particles include all living organisms and their motile 
	constituents such as molecular motors \cite{ramaswamy2010mechanics}. On the other hand, the motion of passive 
	Brownian particles is driven by equilibrium thermal fluctuations due to random collisions with the surrounding 
	fluid molecules\cite{babivc2005colloids}. 

	Because of this property of active brownian particles, 
	their dynamics cannot be described by matter of thermal equilibrium, including, for example, 
	swarming and the emergence of other collective properties\cite{schweitzer2007brownian}.


	In recent years, active Brownian motion has attracted a lot of interest from the biology and physics 
	communities\cite{ebbens2010pursuit, poon2013clarkia}. Several types of microscopic biological entities perform 
	active Brownian motion; a paradigmatic example is the swimming behavior of bacteria such as Escherichia coli
	\cite{volpe2014simulation}. Understanding their motion can provide insight into out-of-equilibrium phenomena
	\cite{volpe2014simulation} and lead to the development of novel strategies for designing smart devices and materials\cite{bechinger2016active}.
	A significant and growing effort has been pushed in recent years, to advancing this field and to explore its applications in a 
	diverse set of disciplines\cite{bechinger2016active}. Some of them are for example statistical physics\cite{ramaswamy2010mechanics}, 
	biology\cite{viswanathan2011physics}, robotics\cite{brambilla2013swarm}, social transport\cite{helbing2001traffic}, 
	soft matter\cite{marchetti2013hydrodynamics} and biomedicine\cite{wang2012nano}.

	In the perspective of application, active particles provide great hope in addressing challenges of our modern societies
	such as personalized health care, environmental sustainability and security\cite{nelson2010microrobots, 
	wang2012nano, patra2013intelligent, gao2014environmental, ebbens2016active}. The possibility of designing and 
	using active particles in real world application is immense, ranging from the targeted delivery of drugs, 
	biomarkers, or contrast agents in health care applications\cite{nelson2010microrobots, wang2012nano, patra2013intelligent, abdelmohsen2014micro} to 
	the autonomous depollution of water and soils, climate changes, or chemical terroristic attacks in sustainability and
	security applications\cite{gao2014environmental}.

	%One of the key feature of active particles is their capability of self-propulsion.
	Self-propelled particles were originally studied to model the swarm behavior of animals at the macroscale\cite{bechinger2016active}. 
	Reynolds introduced in 1987 a ''Boids model'' to simulate noncolliding aggregate motion, such as that of 
	flocks of birds, heards of land animals, and schools of fish within computer graphics applications\cite{reynolds1987flocks}. 
	In 1995, Vicsek and co-authors introduced the ''Vicsek model'' where the swarm behavior is modelled by active particles 
	that are driven with a constant absolute velocity and they tend to align with the average direction of motion of the 
	particles in their neighbourhood\cite{vicsek1995novel}. The Vicsek model was the first model to look at collective motion 
	as a noise-induced phase transition. Then later on, several other models have been introduced aiming to study and 
	explain the properties of collective behaviours\cite{chate2008modeling,grossmann2013self,barberis2016large,mijalkov2016engineering, 
	volpe2016effective,matsui2017noise,cambui2017finite}. Experimental studies has also been done on systems with 
	complex collective behaviours\cite{czirok1996formation, palacci2013living, theurkauff2012dynamic, ginot2015nonequilibrium, morin2017distortion}.
	The collective behavior in swarming systems turns out to 
	occur in many different scales and furthermore the behaviours are robust and universal e.g. the animals share 
	group-level properties, irrespective of the type of animals in the group\cite{buhl2006disorder}.

	This property of universality and scalabilty of collective behaviour will be the main focus 
	of this paper, especially on systems in macroscale. And efforts will be made in trying to answer 
	whether a model describing the behaviour of active brownian particles is scalable i.e. valid 
	in different scales.

	%While there has been alot of work done in this field ranging from studies of cells and bacterias, 
	%simulations of many particles systems, there isn't much studies of the macro scale. In this paper we 
	%aim to dig deeper the see the scalability if this phenomena in macro scale.

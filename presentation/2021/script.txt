Slide 1
    Hello and welcome to my thesis presentation.
    I've met many of you before, many of you I haven't met.
    My name is Thomas and I started doing this thesis two years 
    ago with Giovanni and Alessandro as supervisor. Well the project 
    got dragged out a bit, so forgive me if the some thing is not up to 
    date, but I'll try to present it as clear as possible.
    So without furthur adue I'll proceed.

Slide 2
    As seen, this thesis is called Collective behaviors of autonomous 
    robots in complex environment, which is a mouthful of words. 
    The keyword here is collective behaviors or synonymously 
    collective motion which can be defined as 

    "the spontaneous emergence of ordered movement in 
    a system consisting of many self-propelled agents"

    Collective behaviors is a common process in living systems 
    and be seen everywhere in nature, in different scales both
    macroscopic and microscopic scales. As the name suggests 
    collective behavior involves a collection of agents or 
    units, in other words many agents. 
    
    Here are some examples of systems that exhibit collective behaviors

Slide 3
    On top row you see the single unit that makes up the system and on 
    the bottom is the collective behavior that can emerge out from a 
    systems of similar units. In (B) we have schooling of fishes that swirls 
    around, a defence behavior against predators. In (C) is the flock of birds
    migrating, trevelling on flocks decrease the likelihood of being attacked 
    by predators. (F) cooperation of ants where they are surrounding some sort 
    of liquid. (H) spiral collective motion of bacteria.

    Common to all these systems is that their individual units are capable 
    of self-propulsion. These units are often referred to as Self-prpelled 
    particles or Active particles.

Slide 4
    The term “active” refers here to the ability of 
    individual units to move actively by gaining
    kinetic energy from the environment. All living 
    organisms in different scales can be seen as active particles.

    In microscale we have for example, motile cells, bacteria, synthetic 
    microswimmers. In macroscale already mentioned animals, robots 
    which can be considered as artificial self-propelled particles 
    and also humans. Which can show collective behavior such as situation 
    where pedestrians spontaneously organizing into traffic lanes when 
    moving in opposite directions on a crowded hallway.

    Here are some active particles in different scales.

Slide 5
    In microscale, the kinesin protein walking along microtubule 
    filaments and bacteria swimming on a petri dish.
    I macroscale, a herd of wild cattle crossing a river, and 
    a swarm of starlings.

    The earliest attempt to model collective behavior was done by 
    Reynolds 1987.

Slide 6
    Reynolds introduced the boids model to simulate the
    swarm behavior of animals at the macroscale within computer
    graphics applications. In 1995 Vicsek introduced the Vicsek model 
    where the swarm behavior is modelled by active particles that are driven 
    with a constant absolut velocity and they tend to align with the average 
    direction of motion of the particles in their neighbourhood. 
    The Vicsek model was the first to consider
    collective motion in terms of a noise-induced phase transition
    and, together with its multiple variants, has become one of
    the most often employed models. Here the simplest form the Vicsek model 
    is shown, how the particles position and direction is updated each time step. 
    The positional changes is straighforward. The directional changes includes 
    erandom noise picked from an interval and the average direction of the 
    particles neighbours inside a radius r. 

Slide 7
    Later on several additional models have been introduced to capture the 
    properties of collective behaviors, also experimental studies has been 
    done on systems feature collective behaviors.

    One paper that was a big inspiration for this thesis is 
    "Metastable clusters and channels formed by active particles with
    aligning interactions"

Slide 8
    Done by Nilsson and Volpe 2017. Here active particles were studied 
    using numerical simulations.
